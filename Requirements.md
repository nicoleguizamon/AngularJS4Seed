Write me a Expense Tracker web application where:
- User must be able to create an account and log in
- app should hit to a harcoded backend
- When logged in, user can see and edit expenses he entered
- When entered, each expense has Date, Time, Description, Amount, Comment
- User can filter expenses
- User can print expenses per week with total amount, and average day spending
- Minimal UI/UX design is needed.
- Every client operation should be done using JavaScript, reloading the page is not an option.
- You need to login to the application to enter expenses.
- As complementary to the last item, one should be able to create users in the system via an interface, probably a signup/register screen.
